## Zach Arani, Clayton McFarland, Jake Crampton, and Shiloh Beeler

This is a visual novel/strategy simulator with the goal to teach STEM Education. The main characters are various types of plant stems which attend school, and compete in a quiz style competition in the form of a Fire Emblem style game.   

To run the game, just clone the repository and run master.py. After finishing the visual novel portion, you will be put into the strategy game portion where answering quiz questions correctly will help you in battle.  




The basic movement and layout of the simulator was inspired by: https://github.com/Animostas/PygameFireEmblem
